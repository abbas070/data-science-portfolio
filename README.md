# Data Science Portfolio
This repository is containing several independent data science projects that I have worked on recently for educational purposes. Some of these projects were completed under Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree program, more information can be found [here](https://notebook.community/).

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Google Colab, Vscode etc.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/predicting_boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/donor_search/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/creating_customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/smartcab_driving_training): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
	- [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/mnist-digit-recognition/mnist-digit-classification.ipynb):  Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.

_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/blob/main/site/en/tutorials/keras/text_classification.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.

- ### Data Analysis and Visualization
	- __Python__
		- [911 Calls - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/911-analysis/911%20Calls%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.
		- [Stock Market Analysis for Tech Stocks](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/stock-market-analysis/Stock%20Market%20Analysis%20for%20Tech%20Stocks.ipynb): Analysis of technology stocks including change in price over time, daily returns, and stock behaviour prediction.
		- [2016 US General Election Poll Data Analysis](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/election-poll-analysis/2016%20General%20Election%20Poll%20Analysis.ipynb): Very simple analysis of 2016 US General Election Poll data.

_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib_

	- __R__
		- [Inferential Statistics: Do men or women oppose sex education?](https://rpubs.com/Elmurad/stats-inference) : Using the GSS (General Social Survey) dataset to infer if, in the year 2012, were men, of 18 years or above in the United States, more likely to oppose sex education in public schools than women.
