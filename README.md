# Data Science Portfolio
This repository is containing several independent data science projects that I have worked on recently for educational purposes. Some of these projects were completed under Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree program, more information can be found [here](https://notebook.community/).

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Google Colab, Vscode etc.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

 	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/predicting_boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/donor_search/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/creating_customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/smartcab_driving_training): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
	- [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs](https://github.com/abbas070/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/mnist-digit-recognition/mnist-digit-classification.ipynb):  Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.
