# Data Science Portfolio

Hello. My name is Elmurad Abbasov and I have graduated this May from University of Minnesota - Morris. This repository is containing several independent data science, software development, data analytics and machine learning projects that I have worked on recently for educational purposes. Some of these projects were completed under Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree program, more information can be found [here](https://notebook.community/). 

I am located in the United States and open to work in both Data Science and Software Engineering. Below is my contact information.
